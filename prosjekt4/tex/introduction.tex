\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Statistical mechanics aims to describe thermodynamics from a quantum mechanical point of view.
Just as classical mechanics should be the large-scale approximation to quantum mechanics,
thermodynamics should be the large-scale approximation to statistical mechanics. A concept
which relates classical quantities such as the total energy, heat capacity, entropy, and pressure, is
the partition function
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:partition}
    Z = \sum_s e^{-\frac{E_s}{kT}},
  \end{equation}
where $k$ is Boltzmann's constant, $T$ is the temperature, and $E_i$ is the energy for each microstate $s$.
Eq. \ref{eq:partition} describes the statistical properties of a system in thermal equillibrium.
While useful and interesting theoretically, analytical solutions are rare to come by. In particular,
it is quite difficult to calculate the microstate energies.

The aim of this report is then to find the microstate energies numerically, using
the Metropolis algorithm to
