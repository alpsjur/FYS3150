In this report we look at phase transitions in the Ising model using the Metropolis algorithm. We find that the Metropolis algorithm in this case produces a probability distribution resembling the gamma distribution, but no further analysis is done. Looking at all relevant parameters, we find an increase in energy with and decrease in absolute magnetisation with increasing temperature. Furthermore, we find signs of a phase transition from maximum's in the heat capacity and susceptibility for a temperature domain $T \in [2.26, 2.3]$. Closer analysis employing a power law yields a critical temperature of $2.$
