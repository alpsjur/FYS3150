In this report we consider numerical and physical aspects of the Ising model and Metropolis algorithm. We find that the Metropolis algorithm produces a probability distribution resembling the gamma distribution, but no further analysis is done. A correspondence is found when comparing the distribution with the expectation value and standard deviation. Correlation between the probability distributions and accepted states is also found. Furthermore, we find an increase in energy and decrease in absolute magnetisation with increasing temperature, as well as signs of a phase transition from maxima in the heat capacity and susceptibility in the temperature domain $T \in [2.26, 2.3]$. Closer analysis employing a power law yields a critical temperature of $2.271 \pm 0.012 [\frac{k_bK}{J}]$, which is within one standard deviation of the estimated analytical value. We therefore conclude that the Metropolis algorithm yields relatively accurate results in simulating the Ising model.
