\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

The first thing we measured was the convergence rate of Jacobi's algorithm, see Figure \ref{fig:n_vs_it}.
We see that after some fluctuations for low n, the curve becomes linear as n increases, with a slope of approximately 2.
As this is in logspace, we have that the number of iterations increases as $\sim  n^2$.

	\label{fig:n_vs_it}
\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig:CPUtime} we compare the CPU time between Jacobi's method and
armadillo's built-in eigenvalue solver, where we see that the CPU time of Jacobi's method
has a similar shape as in Figure \ref{fig:n_vs_it}. Looking at the graph for the armadillo
function we see that the slope is rising slower, but have a similar shape, except
for the fluctuations occuring after the $\log_{10} n = 1.25$ mark.

\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig:error}, we show the maximum relative error of the Jacobi
algorithm when computing the eigenvalues in the buckling beam problem. We see that the error increases with a steep slope for low n, before converging towards a constant error for increasing n.

Having benchmarked our implementation of Jacobi's algorithm, we then study the case
of electrons in an harmonic oscillator potential. In particular, in Figure
\ref{fig:quantum_dots_nointer}, we looked at the effects of varying $\omega_r$ in the
ground state. We see that for increasing $\omega_r$, the wavefunction became
narrower and closer to the origin. The energy eigenvalues also increases as a function of $\omega_r$.

	Underneath is the energy eigenvalue $\lambda_0$ as a function of $\omega_r$.}
	\label{fig:quantum_dots_nointer}
\end{figure}


Finally, studying the effects of the Coloumb interaction, we compare the same case
as in Figure \ref{fig:quantum_dots_nointer} with and without the Coloumb interaction.
In Figure \ref{fig:quantum_dots_yesinter} then, we see that the wavefunctions are
all shifted out from the origin, as well as being wider. For the energy eigenvalues,
we see that for every $\omega_r$ the value increases more and more for increasing $\omega_r$.

	We compare the case of no interaction between the electrons (blue) and the case of
	interaction between the electrons (pink).}
