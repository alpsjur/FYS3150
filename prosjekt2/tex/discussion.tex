As we have seen in Figure \ref{fig:CPUtime}, Jacobi's method is quite time consuming for large $n$. Here, our implementation of Jacobi's method is more efficient than Armadillo's function for $n$ smaller than about 20. But for larger $n$ the roles have changed. In our case, $n$ is the resolution in the discretization of the displacement function for the buckling beam, and of the wave function for the electron(s). So large $n$ is usually preferred. 

As we see in Figure \ref{fig:n_vs_it}, the number of iterations is proportional to $n^2$.
