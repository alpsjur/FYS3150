\section{Results}

Looking at Figure \ref{fig:hovmollerSinePeriodic}, we observe the time evolution of a sine wave in the periodic domain. We see that the wave is easterly (travelling towards the west). There are four distinct anti-nodes throughout the entire duration of the wave, and a wavelength is determined to be $0.5$. After a time $t=140$ we can see that the wave is in anti-phase to its initial state.

\end{figure}

Considering now the bounded sine wave (Figure \ref{fig:hovmollerSineBounded}), the direction of propagation is still west, and the four anti-nodes look to be reduced by two, yielding only two anti-nodes at any point in time. We can approximate a wavelength to be $0.6$. The same behaviour after time $t=140$ is also observed here.

From Figure \ref{fig:hovmollerGaussianPeriodic} we see that the periodic gaussian wave exhibits different behaviour caompared to the sine wave. There are at most two distinct anti-nodes at any point in time, and there looks to be a changing pattern in time, compared to the sine waves which always look the same. No wavelength can be discerned from the diagram.

In Figure \ref{fig:hovmollerGaussianBounded} we show the Hovmöller diagram of a gaussian with closed boundaries. In this case, while there are still variations in time, we can clearly discern oscillations between minima and maxima.
