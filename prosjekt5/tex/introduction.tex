\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

We encounter wave phenomena everywhere in the natural sciences. From quantum mechanics to oceanography, we find that be it the motion of a particle or the ocean, we require knowledge of wave-like behaviour to solve the problem. In quantum mechanics, a particle's wave function is described by a complex-valued diffusion equation, the Schr√∂dinger equation, while in oceanography, we can describe ocean waves using the wave equation,
	\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:wave}
	\pdv[2]{u}{x} = \pdv[2]{u}{t},
	\end{equation}
where x and t denote the spatial and temporal coordinates, respectively. The wave equation will be the topic of this paper, in particular, we will model Rossby waves, first identified by \citet{rossby}. These are inertial, planetary waves in the Earth's atmosphere and ocean which motions contribute to extreme weather \citet{mann2017influence},
