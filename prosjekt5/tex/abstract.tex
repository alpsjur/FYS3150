  In this article, we solve the barotropic Rossby wave equation in the beta plane approximation for both bounded and periodic boundaries, using two different initial waves: a sine and gaussian. Numerically, we compare two implicit (centered) and explicit (forward) finite difference schemes. We study the stability and accuracy of both methods. From this analysis, we find that the centered scheme is stable to a higher time step $\Delta t$, and more accurate with a truncation error of order $\order{\Delta x^2}$. Using Hovm√∂ller diagrams, we find that all our solutions propagate westward. For the sine wave, we can discern phase velocities: $v_p\approx -0.0063\,$ in the periodic domain (agreeing with the analytical value) and $v_p \approx -0.0050\,$ in the bounded domain. In two dimensions, we find that our solutions propagate only westward. This implies that the one-dimensional problem is a good representation of the two-dimensional problem.
