  In this article, we study Rossby waves using different both implicit and explicit schemes for solving the wave equation numerically. We consider both the advantages and disadvantages of the methods, as well as their efficiency and accuracy. From this analysis, we find that the implicit scheme (centered) is more accurate and stable.
