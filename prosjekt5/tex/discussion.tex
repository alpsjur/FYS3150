Looking back at the Hovmöller diagrams, we find that Figure \ref{fig:hovmollerSinePeriodic} corresponds well with the analytical expression in eq. \ref{eq:periodic sol} as shown in the figure is the very distinct Hovmöller diagram for a cosine wave with a constant amplitude of 1. In the bounded case (Figure \ref{fig:hovmollerSineBounded}) we find that the amplitude oscillates with $\sin{x}$ as expected. Both waves are easterlies, which is as expected from the analytical negative dispersion relation (eq. \ref{eq:phasespeed}), and correlates with Rossby's original observations \citep{rossby}.

As for the gaussian waves, we have no analytical solutions, but find that
