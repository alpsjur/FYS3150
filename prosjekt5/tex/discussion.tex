Looking back at the Hovmöller diagrams, we find that Figure \ref{fig:hovmollerSinePeriodic} corresponds well with the analytical expression in eq. \ref{eq:periodic sol} as shown in the figure is the very distinct Hovmöller diagram for a cosine wave with a constant amplitude of 1. In the bounded case (Figure \ref{fig:hovmollerSineBounded}) we find that the amplitude is still 1, as expected from the analytical result, taking into account that the equilibrium line oscillates around the initial equilibrium line, also with an amplitude of 1. The Gaussian initial condition does not yield results comparable to the analytical expression. However, both waves are easterlies, which is as expected from the analytical negative dispersion relation (eq. \ref{eq:phasespeed}), and correlates with Rossby's original observations \citep{rossby}. 

It should be noted that due to a lack of time, the code used to generate the data shown in Figure \ref{fig:periodicsine2d} does not handle the eastward boundary correctly.
