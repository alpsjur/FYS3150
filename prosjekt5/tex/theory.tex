\subsection{Partial differential equations}
\label{sec:pde}
Partial differential equations can often be separated into a set of coupled ordinary differential equations which are easier to solve.

\subsection{Implementation}
\label{sec:implement}
We implement our algorithms in C++ using the armadillo and LAPACK libraries to handle matrix operations. To analyse data and produce figures, we use python 3.6 with a standard set of modules: matplotlib, numpy and seaborn.
