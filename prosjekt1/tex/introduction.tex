\section{Introduction}

Solving differential equations is an integral part of the physical sciences,
since most differential equations cannot be solved analytically, they are solved
numerically. Large scale models, like climate models or many-body systems, often
consist of many complex coupled differential equations. 
In this report we compare two numerical methods of solving differential
equations. More specifically, we solve Poisson's equation
  \begin{equation}
    \dv[2]{\phi}{r} = -4\pi r \rho (r),
  \end{equation}
using both gaussian elimination and LU-decomposition (see \cref{methods}).
