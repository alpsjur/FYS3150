Considering first Figure \ref{fig:compare euler verlet}, we see

In Figure \ref{fig:earth escape} we see that

In Figure \ref{fig:changing beta} we show the speed of the Earth and the distance of the Earth from the sun, and the effects of increasing the exponent in the $\frac{1}{r^2}\,$-proportionality of NLG as described in Section \ref{sec:beta}. We see that for the case where $\beta=2.5$ the phase of the distance and velocity seem to shift toward the right, with perhaps a slight increase in amplitude for both values. Increasing $\beta$ to the $[2.9, 3]$ range we see an increase in amplitude for $\beta = 2.9$ and a greater wavelength for both values. As $\beta \rightarrow 3\,$, the speed rapidly increases while the distance decreases.

Increasing Jupiter's mass as described in Section \ref{sec:numex}, we produced Figure \ref{fig:jupiter mass}. Here the original orbits are shown as reference. Increasing Jupiter's mass tenfold, we saw that the orbits remained the same.
For $1000m_{\text{Jupiter}}$, it appears that Earth is dislodged from its orbit around the sun, while Jupiter's orbit is more elliptical and closer to the sun.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{jupiter_mass.pdf}
	\caption{Plot showing the trajectories of Earth, Jupiter and the sun for different values for the mass of Jupiter. The upper plot shows the original orbits of a Sun-Earth-Jupiter system, i. e. $1m_{\text{Jupiter}}$. On the bottom left is the orbits when $10m_{\text{Jupiter}}$, and on the bottom right when $1000m_{\text{Jupiter}}$.}

Looking now at Figure \ref{fig:centre of mass}, we show the orbit of the sun when the centre of mass is set as the origin and the sun is given an initial velocity so that the momentum of the system is zero. The figure also shows how the absolute value of the position vector of Jupiter and Earth changes when the origin is changed from the sun to the centre of mass. Both the radius of Sun's orbit and the maximum change in the position vector of Earth has a magnitude of about $10^{-3}$ AU. The change in the position vector of Jupiter has a maximum magnitude of about $10^{-2}$ AU.

In Figure \ref{fig:solar system} the final model including all the planets is shown in three dimensions. For a two dimensional plot of the xy-plane, see Figure \ref{fig:solar system2d} in the Appendix.

Figure \ref{fig:perihelion} shows the perihelion precession of Mercury over a century. Both the classical and the relativistic case is shown. We see that in the relativistic case Mercury has a linear change in precession of about 43 arc seconds, while in the classical case the change is close to zero.
