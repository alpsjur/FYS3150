  We develop an object-oriented program for simulating many-body systems. In particular,
  we create a model of the solar system. First, we compare two different numerical methods of solving ordinary differential equations: the Forward Euler (FE) and Velocity Verlet (VV) algorithms. Considering efficiency and accuracy,
  we find that the VV algorithm is clearly superior in accuracy as it conserves energy and angular momentum. While FE runs faster by about $number$ when comparing integration steps, its low accuracy makes VV more efficient in practice. Performing various numerical experiments on different configurations of planets, we consider the Sun-Earth-(Jupiter) and Sun-Mercury systems (SES, SEJS, SEM)
