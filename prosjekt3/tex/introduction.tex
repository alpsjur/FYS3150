\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

In physics we often encounter many-body systems such as particles around a nucleus,
molecules flowing as a liquid and planets bound by the Sun's gravitational field.
What is common for all such systems is that the bodies themselves, such as
electrons, $H_2 O$, and Earth and Jupiter, often have the same general properties.
These properties, such as charge and mass, have fields such as the electromagnetic field
and the gravitational field which will affect other charges and masses. From this,
we have motion which is decribed by field equations, such as Maxwell's field equations
and Newtons law of gravitation. In general then, what we have are properties and a
corresponding law relating the effect
